# Hi, I'm Kyungtae Kim 👋
### Backend Software Engineer | System Reliability & Legacy Modernization

Originally trained in **Aircraft Mechanical Engineering**, I translate the rigor and "safety-first" mindset of aerospace standards into building high-reliability, fault-tolerant software systems. I specialize in modernizing legacy architectures and optimizing performance-critical backend pipelines.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java (17, 11), Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, JPA, MyBatis, QueryDSL
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Tuning Specialist), MariaDB, MSSQL, Redis
- **DevOps:** Docker, Jenkins, Git, Linux (RHEL/Ubuntu)
- **Observability:** OpenSearch, Filebeat, Kibana (ELK Stack)
- **Architecture:** MSA, Event-Driven, Legacy Modernization, ADR-driven development

### 🚀 Key Projects

#### **Secudium V3 Modernization (Currently at SecuLayer)**
- Spearheading the migration of a 10-year-old security configuration engine to a modern Spring Boot & MSA architecture.
- Designed a **Cross-Context Session Injection** strategy to unify legacy and modern authentication layers.
- Optimized massive rule ingestion using **MyBatis Batch**, significantly reducing system load.

#### **Hi-Learning EdTech Platform**
- Achieved a **78% reduction in query latency** by refactoring complex PostgreSQL execution plans.
- Architected a **Hybrid Frontend (Non-SFC Vue.js)** integration within a legacy JSP environment.
- Managed a complex **4-WAS topology** ensuring 24/7 availability for thousands of schools.

#### **MICE Forum CMS (POC)**
- Built a secure, high-concurrency reservation system using **Pessimistic Locking** via QueryDSL.
- Implemented a **Selenium + Spring Batch** crawling pipeline with Redis-based deduplication.
