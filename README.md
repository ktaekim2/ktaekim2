# Hi, I'm Kyungtae Kim 👋
### Backend Software Engineer | System Reliability & Legacy Modernization

Originally trained in **Aircraft Mechanical Engineering**, I translate the rigor and "safety-first" mindset of aerospace standards into building high-reliability, fault-tolerant software systems. I specialize in modernizing legacy architectures and optimizing performance-critical backend pipelines.
